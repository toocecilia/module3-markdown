# Exercise-3

In the space below, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

- A _heading_ with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly. See `complete` branch for an example.

# `git status` Command

According to the command line manual, the command `git status` shows the working tree status. (This definition can be found in the entry for `git`).

What can you do with `git status`?
- `git status` is like `pwd` but for version control.
- When making commits of files to your repo, you should enter the `git status` command after _every_ step.
- `git status` will ensure that you are tracking with the commit process from start to finish.
- It's a good idea to begin making a commit with the command `git status`!
